## Pre-Reading: Skim to Identify Key Sections

Before diving deep, skim the paper to identify its structure and relevance. Start with the **abstract**, a concise summary of the research. Next, scan the **introduction** to grasp the problem statement and objectives. The **conclusion** often reveals the study’s main findings. For technical papers, review the **methodology** section to understand the research design. Use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) to search for keywords like 'hypothesis' or 'results.' This pre-reading phase helps you decide whether the paper aligns with your goals and where to focus your attention.

Technical terms like *peer-reviewed* (vetted by experts) or *empirical study* (data-driven research) appear frequently. Don’t get stuck; circle unclear terms and revisit them later.

Example: To locate key sections quickly in a PDF, use a reader like Adobe Acrobat or [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/). Highlight headings with different colors:

```bash
# Use command-line tools like pdftotext to extract text for keyword searches
