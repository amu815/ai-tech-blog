## Introduction to the Ruling
The US Supreme Court has made a significant decision regarding President Trump's global tariffs. In a move that has sent shockwaves through the White House, the court struck down the tariffs, leading to a flurry of activity as officials scrambled to respond.

## The Scene at the White House
On the morning of the announcement, the White House was relatively quiet, with reporters waiting for an official reaction. However, this calm was short-lived, as news broke that President Trump would be holding a briefing in the press room. The sudden announcement sparked a frenzy of activity, with journalists rushing to secure their spots and set up equipment.

## Significance of the Decision
The last-minute presidential briefing is a rare occurrence, highlighting the importance of the Supreme Court's decision. This move is only the second of its kind since President Trump returned to office in January last year, underscoring the gravity of the situation. The previous instance was in response to a tragic accident involving a plane and helicopter collision over the Potomac River.

## Aftermath and Next Steps
As the news continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the Supreme Court's ruling. One thing is certain: this decision will have far-reaching implications for US trade policy and the global economy. The White House will likely face intense scrutiny in the coming days as it navigates this complex issue.
